##Section A: Database Fundamentals

1.Main types of databases:
Relational (RDBMS), NoSQL (document, key-value, column, graph), Cloud databases, Data warehouses.

2.RDBMS:
A system that stores data in tables with rows and columns and lets you manage it using SQL.

3. Primary key & foreign key:
Primary key: Unique identifier for a row in a table.
Foreign key: A field in one table that links to the primary key in another table.

4.Database normalization:
Organizing data to reduce duplicates and improve efficiency.

5.Database schema:
The structure of a database (tables, columns, relationships).

6.Structured, semi-structured, unstructured data:
Structured: Organized in tables (like SQL).
Semi-structured: Some organization, like JSON or XML.
Unstructured: No fixed format, like videos, images, or text files.

7.Fact table vs Dimension table:
Fact table: Stores measurable data (sales, revenue).
Dimension table: Stores descriptive data (customer, product info).

8.Data model:
A plan for how data is stored and related. Helps design databases correctly.

9.Database vs Data warehouse vs Data lake:
Database: Current, transactional data.
Data warehouse: Large, cleaned, historical data for analysis.
Data lake: Raw data stored in any format.

10.Data mart vs Data warehouse:
Data mart: Smaller, focused on a department or topic.
Data warehouse: Company-wide, stores all cleaned data.



### Section B: SQL and Data Handling

11.Query language & SQL:
A way to ask databases for information. SQL is common because it’s standard and easy to use.

12.Indexes:
Special lookup tables that make searching data faster.

13.Transactions & ACID:
Transaction: A group of actions done together in a database.

14.ACID: Ensures transactions are reliable:
A: Atomic (all or nothing)
C: Consistent
I: Isolated (independent)
D: Durable (saved permanently)

14.Database engine:
The software that reads/writes data in a database. Faster engines = better performance.

15.Views, stored procedures, triggers:
View: Virtual table based on a query.
Stored procedure: Pre-written SQL code you can run multiple times.
Trigger: Code that runs automatically when data changes.

16.ETL vs ELT:
ETL: Extract → Transform → Load (clean first, then store).
ELT: Extract → Load → Transform (store first, then clean).

17.Batch vs stream processing:
Batch: Process data in chunks.
Stream: Process data in real-time as it comes.

18.Joins in SQL:
Combine data from multiple tables. Types:
INNER JOIN: Only matching rows
LEFT JOIN: All rows from left + matches from right
RIGHT JOIN: All rows from right + matches from left
FULL JOIN: All rows from both tables

19.Referential integrity:
Ensures foreign keys match primary keys, keeping data consistent.

20.Data redundancy:
Storing the same data multiple times. Wastes space and can slow performance.



##Section C: Data Management and Analytics

21.Cloud vs on-premise database:
Cloud: Access over the internet, scalable, managed by provider.
On-premise: Installed on company servers, more control, more maintenance.

22.Data governance:
Rules and processes to manage data properly and safely.

23.Data integrity:
Keeping data accurate and reliable. Use validation, constraints, backups.

24.Data quality:
Data should be accurate, complete, and timely. Important for correct analysis.

25.Data Analyst role:
Collect, clean, analyze, and report insights from data.

26.Database Administrator (DBA) tasks:
Manage, secure, backup, and optimize databases.

27.Steps in designing a data pipeline:
Collect → Clean → Transform → Load → Analyze data.

28.Challenges with large databases:
Performance issues, storage limits, backups, data consistency, security.

29.Popular database platforms & use cases:
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Web apps
Oracle: Large enterprises
Snowflake: Cloud analytics
MongoDB: NoSQL document storage

30. Data storage formats:
CSV: Simple, easy to read
JSON: Semi-structured
Parquet/Avro: Optimized for analytics, faster queries
